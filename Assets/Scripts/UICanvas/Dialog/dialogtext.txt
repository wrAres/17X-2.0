Walking Puzzle Hint 1
The remainder of some sentence shows up on the star:
“Hi there, brave latecomer, I have studied the long walking maze =for a while, the spiritual power in the maze led me to the secret =of the mirrored world.
I believe the power to unlock the mirrored status is to eventually =grow a plant somewhere. A complex plant that needs a lot of effort =to take care of.
Hopefully, this message can help you, and I’ll try to record some =other information deeper in the maze.”
---
Walking Puzzle Hint 2
The remainder of some sentence shows up on the star:
“You have probably seen my first message, the secret behind this =mirrored situation is far more serious than I imagined.
I think there is a great power controlling the maze and this =environment. Based on my interpretation of energy flow in the maze, =I feel the plant has a special seed somewhere,
and planting the seed with dirt will be a great attempt to solve this =strange situation, and oh, don’t forget to water the seed to see =what happens.”
---
Walking Puzzle Hint 3

“I have carved a message about how to start the growing of the =plant somewhere in the maze, don’t know if you’ve seen it.
But, anyway, you will see the strong wood energy of that plant after =it grows. In the sense of wood energy, I think the energy will take 
you on a path to the fire energy in the previous environment if you =remember.
Well, I’ll be brief here, because I am going to try to get back to =the previous environment according to the wood energy trajectory.”
---
Walking Puzzle Hint 4
The remainder of several sentences appear up on the star:
“Shit, this could be the last message I leave here, this is the far =end of the maze, it shows the existence of fire energy after the 
wood energy is needed to make the most Yang sun element to =complete the growing process.
But unfortunately, I failed once in teleporting back to the previous =environment because I used the wrong components to create the =teleport magic.
Good luck on your adventure, mine is likely over.”

rockInWaterRoom
The remainder of several sentences is carved on the rock:

This is the last piece of strength that I can use…”
The sentence just ends here...
