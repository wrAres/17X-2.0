Walking Puzzle Hint 1
(Someone have carved)=Hi there, brave latecomer, I had studied the long walking maze for =a while, the spiritual power in the maze tracked to the secret of =the mirrored world.
I believe the power to unlock the mirrored status is eventually =growing a plant somewhere, and it is a complex plant that needs =a lot of effort to take care of.
Hopefully, this message can help you out, and I’ll try to record =some other information as well in the maze.
---
Walking Puzzle Hint 2
(Someone have carved)=You probably had seen my first message, the secret behind =this mirrored situation is far more serious than I imagined.
I think there is a great power controlling the maze and this =environment. Based on the interpretation of energy flow in the maze, =I can feel the plant has a distinguish looking seed =somewhere,
and plant the seed with dirt will be a great try to solve this =strange situation, and oh, don’t forget to water the seed to see =what happens. 
---
Walking Puzzle Hint 3
(Someone have carved)=I have carved a message about how to start the growing of the =plant somewhere in the maze, don’t know if you had seen it.
But, anyway, you will see the strong wood energy of that plant after =it grows. In the sense of wood energy, I think the energy leads a =trackable route to the fire energy in the previous environment =if you remember.
Well, I’ll be brief here, because I am gonna try to get back =the previous environment according to the wood energy trajectory. 
---
Walking Puzzle Hint 4
(Someone have carved)=S**t, this could be the last message I left here, this is the far =end of the maze, it shows the fire energy after the wood energy =is needed to make the Yangest sun element to eventually
finish the growing process.
But unfortunately, I failed once in teleporting back to the previous =environment because I used the wrong components to create teleport magic. =Good luck on your adventure, I probably gonna die here.
---
rockInWaterRoom
The remainder of a sentence is curved on the hard rock:
Hopefully you have found the four messages I left in the maze, =I think the last help I can give is that you need to find =the mirror that contains the exact same plant, =but I won’t be able to see the ultimate secret.
This is the last piece of strength that I can use. Pro64617…=(The sentence just end here)
