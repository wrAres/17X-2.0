Ewww… Where am I? 
Wasn’t I on my way finding the Five-Elements-Seal?
 I remember I almost found it according to the map 
that my teacher left for me. I must find the way out!

Earth Key
Oh, wait! I almost forgot an important thing. In such an unknown place, \nI need to have my “weapons” in hands -- Writing Brush and Talismans.
 They should be in my gourd. I used to store 
everything in my gourd.

Lobby
Wow! An Eight-Trigram-Atlas! I feel the strong
 energies of the other four elements except Earth 
come from four different directions. According to 
what my teacher taught me, Water was the first 
element generated in the world. Maybe I can go
 check the Water energy first.

Spelltree 1
All talisman wizards have their own Spelltree pages
that record spells they have learned in the past. 
We draw those spell-characters in the talisman to 
cast a specific spell.

Spelltree 2
Oh no! My Spelltree is covered by some shells and
I somehow cannot remember mostly anything about 
my spells. Something must be wrong! 
I must find the way out of here.

Talisman 1
… I … I just felt like some of my memories have come back. 
A simple spell would be able to let me cross the river.

Talisman 2
What? There are two dragons entwined on my scrolls. 
The left one looks like the Yellow-Dragon, the God of Earth. 
What is he doing there? Where are my other characters? 
Maybe I should try if I can still use the talisman…
